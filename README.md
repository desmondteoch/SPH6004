## SPH6004 - Advanced Statistical Learning
### Objective¶
To build a predictor that estimates the patients’ chance of intubation in the ICU
- Propose and implement a strategy to select the right features for the predictive model
- Clearly explain the rationale of the proposed strategy
- Clearly explain how the proposed strategy works
- Demonstrate experimentally how the proposed strategy manages to minimise the feature dimensions of the pre-extracted MIMIC data
- With the selected features, implement the predictive models taught in first half of the course and compare their performances in estimating the patients’ chance of intubation in the ICU
- Implement all predictive models correctly
- Evaluate and compare performance of the models
- Clearly explain the better performance of some models
